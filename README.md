# programming-languages-together
Have you ever crossed your mind how to run more than one programming language in one project?

 If the answer is yes, then you will like this project

 I have always heard that the Facebook website is built in PHP but in the recent period, several other languages ​​have been used, such as Python to perform a specific function such as analyzing images and detecting defective ones 

 But how did that happen!?  Do you convert the entire site to this language !?  Is there another way?

 Today, you can use two or more programming languages ​​in your project in several ways, including:

 * Create an API that performs a specific function on an external server and link it to your project 

 * Using some methods that implement shell script codes 

 Well what does shellscript mean:

 It is a computer program designed to work by the Unix shell. There are several types of shell script languages, which are considered script languages ​​and are run through the command line interface of the operating system and are considered as an external shell to deal with programs.  Wikipedia 

 In this case, you will run another language in the same way that you run it on the command line 

 This case distinguishes that it is less expensive than the first method
